        <p>I've been using <a href="https://sanity.io">sanity.io</a> for a while now, at least a year, sporadically. And while there are a ton of good things to shout about, I want to talk about <a href="https://www.sanity.io/guides/introduction-to-portable-text">Portable Text</a> and Serailizers.</p>
<p>I'm no expert with the Sanity system yet, it's such a good system to just get going without delving too deeply when starting out, but I've recently had an <em><strong>Ah ha</strong></em> moment with Portable Text, which I'd like to share.</p>
<p><em>These are the moments I love while learning something new - When some of the dots you've been playing with start to connect.</em></p>
<p>I had two relatively simple issues and one complex (or so I thought).</p>
<ol>
<li>The first two were about links within posts that needed to be styled a certain way as well as needing some of those links to open in a new window.</li>
<li>The third issue had to do with styling a blockquote in a particular way.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be noted that I'm building a static site, which plays nicely with how Sanity works. And I must also stress that <strong>I didn't want my users to add any markup or styling to the content</strong> within Sanity Studio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All three of my issues were solved with Marks and Markdefs. A lot of my time was spent reading <a href="https://www.sanity.io/guides/portable-text-internal-and-external-links">their method of handling links</a> and about <a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/block-content">blocks in general</a>. However my link version differs from theirs. Let me explain.</p>
<h2>The Blockquote issue</h2>
<h3>The problem:</h3>
<p>Provide a way for users to add a background colour and a text colour to a blockquote within an article, without overly compromising the content.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong>: Create a colour swatch document, that contains a hex for both the background and text colours.</p>
<p>To create a reasonable exeprience for the user, I created a [react] component to help visualise the changes (I've not shown the component code for brevity):</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxcpo9dzb/image/upload/v1614443051/blog/sanity-swatch-plugin_mdohnh.png" alt="Sanity Component"></p>
<p>I then updated the Colour Swatch schema to make use of the new component.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Swatch schema
import Swatch from '../components/ColourSwatch'
...
fields: [
  ...
    {
      title: 'Colours',
      name: 'swatch',
      type: 'object',
      description: &quot;...&quot;,
  --&gt; inputComponent: Swatch,
    }
  ...
]
...
</code></pre>
<p>All Swatches are a sanity <em>document</em>, which means they'll be treated like royalty!</p>
<p>Next I updated the schema where the blockquote was being used, so the text field could apply the Swatch document to a highlighted section of text.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// article schema
...
  name: &quot;article&quot;,
  type: &quot;array&quot;
  of: [
    {
      type: &quot;blocks&quot;,
      marks: {
        annotations: [
          {
              name: &quot;colourSwatch&quot;,
              type: &quot;object&quot;,
              title: &quot;Colour Swatch&quot;,
              fields: [
                  {
                      name: &quot;swatchRef&quot;,
                      type: &quot;reference&quot;,
                      title: &quot;Colour Swatch&quot;,
                      to: [
                          { type: &quot;swatch&quot; },
                      ],
                  },
              ],
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
...
</code></pre>
<p>Now our users can create a blockquote, highlight it and apply a Swatch to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxcpo9dzb/image/upload/v1614444280/blog/sanity-annotation_sotx3i.png" alt="Block annotation"></p>
<p>Brilliant! But now what? Rendering this page delivers no visual changes! What did I miss?</p>
<h2>GROQ and Serailizers to the rescue</h2>
<p>To ensure the content is transformed correctly, we need to make sure the relevant <code>markDefs</code> get returned. To do this we have to update our query (Like GraphQL, we decide what we want returned).</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// GROQ query
article[ ]{
  ...
  markDefs[ ]{
      ...
      &quot;colourSwatch&quot;: swatchRef-&gt;{
          &quot;background&quot;: swatch.background,
          &quot;text&quot;: swatch.text
      }
      ...
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, by extending/creating the Serailizers, you are able to hook into the build flow of Portable Text. When the serializer encounters a blockquote, you are given access to not only the blockquote, but also the <code>props</code> and modifications applied to it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import renderer from &quot;@sanity/block-content-to-html&quot;;
const h = renderer.h;

export const serializers = {
  ...
  marks: {
    colourSwatch: (props) =&gt; {
        return h(
            &quot;span&quot;, 
            {
                style: {
                    'background-color': props.mark.colourSwatch.background,
                    color: props.mark.colourSwatch.text,
                }
            },
            props.children
        );
    }
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>At this point you're free to return whatever you like, but in my case I was able to use the <code>props</code> to get the applied Swatch, with colours, and return a blockquote with the correct style attached.</p>
<h2>The Link issues.</h2>
<p>The other two issues followed a similar pattern, however, I didn't need to create a new document. I simply asked the serializer to modify links, when it encountered them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">import renderer from &quot;@sanity/block-content-to-html&quot;;
const h = renderer.h;

export const serializers = {
  ...
  marks: {
    link: (props) =&gt; {
      // handle internal/external links
      const href = props.mark.href
      const target = (href &amp;&amp; href.indexOf('mydomain.') &gt; -1)
          ? &quot;_self&quot;
          :&quot;_blank&quot;;

      // Insert the &lt;span&gt; tag
      return h(
        &quot;a&quot;,
        { href, target },
        h(
          &quot;span&quot;,
          null,
          props.children
        )
      )
    }
  }
  ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, I am given access to the link element and I'm allowed to return whatever I like. In this instance I am adding a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag as a child of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. In addition to this, I am also checking the actual link to see if it's an external or internal link and updating the target attribute.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>As I'm building a static site, this is incredibly valuable, because normally you would do all of this dynamically, when the page is requested. As it stands I have pre rendered html pages, with correctly formatted links and correctly styled blockquotes. All without seriously crippling the core content, or even modifying the template.</p>
<p>I admit, this is a very quick overview and I've glossed over a few areas. But understanding Portable text is key to doing great things with this Headless CMS.</p>
<p>Thanks Sanity.</p>
